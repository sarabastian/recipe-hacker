Welcome to Recipe Hacker, a convenient CLI app that will help you discover new recipes by making use of the ingredients you already have in your pantry!

~Let's get started~

Instructions:

1. To start recipe hacking, simply run 'bundle install' and enter ruby/bin.run.rb in your command line.

2. You'll be prompted to either sign in, or sign up if you are a new user to the service.

3. Once you're signed in, you'll be prompted to enter three ingredients you have in your fridge/pantry. From there, you'll be given a list of recipes you can make based off of those ingredients!

4. You have the option to save that recipe, view all the recipes you already have saved, and manage that list (i.e. delete a saved recipe).

5. Now go get recipe-hacking!
